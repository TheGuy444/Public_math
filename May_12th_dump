Comments on how the Formulas were "obtained"

These are formulas I found using an intuitive insight method. They are then processed into a template form shown below using various python scripts.
The possible problem matches is more for an ideal what it coud potentially solve rather then actually being able to solve. It is to give insight on the potential future or current use case.
Given the method these are arrived at ANY possible use case I'm not aware of.

- Formula Cluster: [Symbolic Power Resolution]
- Core Forms:
    - C⁸ = (g² + h²)/(π + π²) + (½ + π)
    - A⁵ = C⁸ + π + σ⁴ + x
    - A⁵ = B
- Observations:
    - System collapses neatly into a definition for B
    - Power symmetry: 8 (C), 5 (A), single layer depth
    - Mix of arithmetic (g² + h², σ⁴) and transcendental (π)
    - Potentially prime-structured if g, h constrained
- Themes:
    - Symbolic closure
    - Transcendental layering
    - Ramanujan-inspired symmetry
- Possible Problem Matches:
    - Fermat-style power constructions
    - Divisor function behavior (σ⁴)

- Formula Cluster: [Prime Paradox Filter]
- Core Forms:
    - Ne² = π * x * y²
    - x = π² + 7e²
    - y = A + b ; A = d² + 7
    - Conditional: If y is prime ⇒ A = 0 ⇒ d² = -7
- Observations:
    - System collapses into imaginary space if y is prime
    - This collapse could define a symbolic prime-detection system

    - B = ((a^2 * π * c)/G)^2 * π - H
- Observations:
    - B scales cubically with a (due to π^3)
    - Foundation in Pythagorean identity
    - Can model geometric or volumetric growth
    - If c, G, H are functions of primes, could trigger pattern collapses
- Themes:
    - Primes (if constrained)
    - Geometric symmetry
    - Exponential growth
    - Transcendental constants (π)
- Possible Problem Matches:

    - P = C * e^4 * (π/2)
- Observations:
    - P scales cleanly with H and G
    - The constant multiplier (πe⁴/2) may have physical/mathematical significance
    - If G is constrained (e.g., prime, triangular), C might become prime
- Themes:
    - Quadratic differences
    - Transcendental scaling
    - Prime testing (potential)
- Possible Problem Matches:
    - Prime distribution

    - A^3 · σ⁴(5/16) = P
    - P · D^3 = F
- Observations:
    - Cubic forms hint at deep algebraic identity
    - Sigma function applied to rational: nonstandard interpretation (curvature or scaling factor?)
    - P links algebraic cube identity to scalar or curvature output F
- Themes:
    - Curvature-modulated arithmetic
    - Symbolic extension of divisor functions
    - Fermat-like Diophantine expression
    - Possible modular or elliptic influence
