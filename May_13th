Comments on how the Formulas were "obtained"

These are formulas I found using an intuitive insight method. They are then processed into a template form shown below using various python scripts.
The possible problem matches is more for an ideal what it coud potentially solve rather then actually being able to solve. It is to give insight on the potential future or current use case.
Given the method these are arrived at ANY possible use case I'm not aware of.

- Formula Cluster: [C-G-A Transformation]		
- Core Forms:		
    - A = C₈ * G² * (C² / 2 * π)		
    - B = A * [0,1,0] * π		
    - C = A - B		
- Observations:		
    - A involves geometric and combinatorial factors.		
    - B scales A via π again, suggesting transcendental manipulation.		
    - C collapses into A(1 - π), hinting at irrational contrast structures.		
- Themes:		
    - primes (possible via C₈)		
    - symmetry (vector selector [0,1,0])		
    - transcendence (π interaction)		
    - combinatorics		
- Possible Problem Matches:		
    - Ramanujan-style identities		
    - Transcendental number theory		
    - Symbolic encodings or formula cryptography

- Core Forms:		
    - A = C₈ * G² * [C² * (½ * π)]		
    - B = A * [0,1,0] * π		
    - C = A - B		
- Observations:		
    - Uses modular construction: indexed constants, powers, fractional π.		
    - Encodes symmetry via ½π and selection vector.		
    - Final term C = A(1 - π) evokes transcendental subtraction.		
- Themes:		
    - symbolic filtering		
    - semicircle/symmetry		
    - transcendental distortion		
    - indexed algebra		
- Possible Problem Matches:		
    - Ramanujan-style transcendental identities		
    - Modular arithmetic or Fourier basis analogy		
    - Symbolic logic frameworks or "function selection" logic
