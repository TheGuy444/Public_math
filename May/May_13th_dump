Comments on how the Formulas were "obtained"

The formulas presented below were obtained through a process of intuitive insight rather than traditional derivation. They are subsequently formatted into structured templates using custom Python scripts for consistency and analysis.

⚠️ Important:
- The "Possible Problem Matches" listed are **not** claims of solutions.
- They are meant to suggest **potential thematic or structural connections** to well-known problems.
- Due to the nature of intuitive discovery, some applications or interpretations may remain unknown—even to me at the time of writing.

- Formula Cluster: [C-G-A Transformation]		
- Core Forms:		
    - A = C₈ * G² * (C² / 2 * π)		
    - B = A * [0,1,0] * π		
    - C = A - B		
- Observations:		
    - A involves geometric and combinatorial factors.		
    - B scales A via π again, suggesting transcendental manipulation.		
    - C collapses into A(1 - π), hinting at irrational contrast structures.		
- Themes:		
    - primes (possible via C₈)		
    - symmetry (vector selector [0,1,0])		
    - transcendence (π interaction)		
    - combinatorics		
- Possible Problem Matches:		
    - Ramanujan-style identities

    - Encodes symmetry via ½π and selection vector.		
    - Final term C = A(1 - π) evokes transcendental subtraction.		
- Themes:
