Started this "experiment" on May 10th, 2025. 

I'm generating 20 - 50 formulas daily. Using my Intuitive based method.

In my first 5 days I discovered 2 possible conjectures and have over 150+ raw formulas that still need logged.

These are all Intuitive based formulas. The use case is not known to me that would require further analysis on others part. 

I'm currently awaiting endorsement for arXiv so that I can publish my 2 conjuctures.
