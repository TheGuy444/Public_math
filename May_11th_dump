Comments on how the Formulas were "obtained"

These are formulas I found using an intuitive insight method. They are then processed into a template form shown below using various python scripts.
The possible problem matches is more for an ideal what it coud potentially solve rather then actually being able to solve. It is to give insight on the potential future or current use case.
Given the method these are arrived at ANY possible use case I'm not aware of.
