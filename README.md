 Intuitive Mathematics — Formula Archive
 
This repository contains a growing archive of symbolic mathematical formulas generated purely through intuitive insight, without relying on formal derivation techniques.
Each formula is processed through a structured YAML-like template using custom Python scripts to ensure consistency, traceability, and easier interpretation.

Interpretation Notes:

"Possible Problem Matches" are not claims of solved problems. They suggest potential connections or thematic overlaps that future analysis may reveal.
Many formulas emerge spontaneously, and their full implications may be unknown—even to me at time of creation.

Purpose:

This repository serves as:

A transparent log of original symbolic mathematical work
A framework for identifying patterns, testing behavior, and tagging high-potential ideas
A reference point for researchers or collaborators who may recognize deeper connections

For inquiries, feel free to open an issue or contact me.
