# Public_math

Every formula I share in this github I found using a Ramanujan style method from intuitive insight. 

They are then processed into a template using various python scripts.

The possible problem matches is more for an idea what it coud potentially solve rather then actually being able to solve. 
It is to give insight on the potential future or current use case.
Given the method these are arrived at ANY possible use case I'm not aware of.
